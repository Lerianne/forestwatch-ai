# forestwatch-ai: Deforestation Segmentation using Deep Learning

## 🌍 Project Overview
This project aims to **detect deforested areas** in Sentinel-2 satellite images using a **custom deep learning model** based on semantic segmentation. The model processes satellite images and generates **segmentation masks**, identifying areas as either **forest** or **deforested land**.
